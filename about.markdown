Just a place to put my musings about trivial questions and topics. My interests revolve around
games, math, programming, and ... bread making. So the posts will likely be about those things.

The title comes from a game, Final Fantasy XIV. The character I play comes from a race called
'lalafels', shortened to 'lalas' and also colloquially known as 'potatoes'. They're adorable
and they should get head pats wherever they go.
